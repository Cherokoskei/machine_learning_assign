This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize patterns in student academic performance, addressing  Quality Education as a Sustainable Development Goal. 
By clustering students based on their math, reading, and writing scores, we aim to uncover learning patterns that can inform targeted educational interventions and resource allocation.



GOAL
To group students based on performance similarity using K-Means Clustering and reduce dimensionality for visualization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).



ðŸ“Œ Key Steps
*Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and selecting relevant features.
*Clustering: Using K-Means to group students by academic similarity.
*Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA to simplify data and visualize clusters.
*Visualization: Showing cluster groups and principal components.
*Insights: Identifying performance groups for personalized learning strategies.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The model revealed distinct clusters of learners with varying performance profiles, helping educators:
 - Understand learning diversity
 -Personalize support and resource
 -Promote inclusive education
